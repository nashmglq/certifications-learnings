# Generative AI Overview

## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence technologies that can generate various types of content, including text, images, audio, and synthetic data. It is a subset of deep learning, which uses artificial neural networks to process both labeled and unlabeled data using supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods.

## What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent agents capable of reasoning, learning, and acting autonomously.

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machine Learning is a subfield of AI where systems are trained to learn from input data. These models can predict outcomes based on the data they have been trained on.

### Types of ML Models
1. **Supervised Learning**: 
   - Involves labeled data, where the model is trained to predict labels (e.g., classifying images of cats vs. dogs).
   - The model is corrected by comparing its predictions to the expected outcomes.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**: 
   - Works with unlabeled data and focuses on discovering patterns or grouping similar data points (e.g., clustering similar items).

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain, to process complex patterns and data. These networks can be trained on both labeled and unlabeled data, allowing them to make predictions and generalizations.

### Types of Learning in Deep Learning
- **Supervised**: Trains on labeled data.
- **Unsupervised**: Works with unlabeled data.
- **Semi-supervised**: Combines a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to improve the model's generalization.

## Generative AI in Detail
Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning that uses models capable of generating new data based on what they have learned from existing data. These models work by learning probability distributions and patterns in the data to create new, similar instances of content.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Discriminative Models**: Classify or predict labels for data points (e.g., is this a dog?).
2. **Generative Models**: Generate new data points by learning the distribution of existing data (e.g., generating images of dogs).

## Large Language Models (LLM)
LLMs are a subset of deep learning, specifically designed to handle natural language tasks. These models process large amounts of text data and can perform a variety of tasks such as translation, summarization, and question-answering.

## How Generative AI Models Work:
- Generative AI models require only input data (such as text, images, or audio) and attempt to learn patterns and structure in the data.
- These models can generate content like natural language text, images, or even audio, based on the patterns they have learned during training.

## Transformer Models
The **Transformer** architecture revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) in 2018. A Transformer consists of two main components:
1. **Encoder**: Processes the input sequence.
2. **Decoder**: Generates relevant output based on the input.

Transformers are highly efficient for tasks involving sequential data, such as language translation and text generation.

## What Are Hallucinations in AI?
Hallucinations refer to incorrect or nonsensical words or phrases generated by AI models. These errors typically occur due to poor-quality data or insufficient context for the model to generate accurate results.

## What is a Prompt?
A **prompt** is a short piece of text provided as input to a large language model (LLM). It directs the model to generate a specific output.

## Types of Input-Output Tasks in Generative AI:

1. **Text-to-Text**:
   - Converts natural language input into text output (e.g., translating text from one language to another).

2. **Text-to-Image**:
   - Converts text input into an image, often using diffusion methods (e.g., generating images based on descriptive text).

3. **Text-to-Video**:
   - Converts a sentence or a full script into a video.

4. **Text-to-3D**:
   - Similar to text-to-video, but generates three-dimensional content.

5. **Text-to-Task**:
   - Performs defined tasks or actions based on text input (e.g., modifying a document through a GUI).

## Foundation Models
A **foundation model** is a large AI model pre-trained on a vast amount of data to perform a wide range of tasks. These models can be fine-tuned for specific downstream applications such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.

## Using Vertex AI Studio for Generative AI
Googleâ€™s **Vertex AI Studio** is a platform where you can build, train, and deploy generative AI models. It enables users to create AI models for a wide variety of use cases.
